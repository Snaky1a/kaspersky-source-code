The generation of this "question" is actually impossible with a single, standard set of Scrabble 
letters (which, interestingly, has 42 vowels). Such a set only has two Ys; but the set shown in the 
TV series has clearly been handmade from memory, so the question buried within Arthur's 
brainwaves may have influenced him in creating it. In the original radio version of the story, 
however, it is made clear that Arthur has been travelling all along with a pocket Scrabble set 
from Earth.
