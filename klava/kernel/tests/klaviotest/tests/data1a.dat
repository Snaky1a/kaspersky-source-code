At the end of the first radio series, the television series, and the book The Restaurant at the End 
of the Universe, the second of the five-book 'trilogy,' Arthur Dent — as the last human to have 
left the Earth before its destruction, therefore the portion of the computer matrix most likely to 
hold the question — attempts to discover the Question by extracting it from his unconscious 
mind, through pulling Scrabble letters at random out of a sack. The result is the sentence 
"WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU MULTIPLY SIX BY NINE."

The generation of this "question" is actually impossible with a single, standard set of Scrabble 
letters (which, interestingly, has 42 vowels). Such a set only has two Ys; but the set shown in the 
TV series has clearly been handmade from memory, so the question buried within Arthur's 
brainwaves may have influenced him in creating it. In the original radio version of the story, 
however, it is made clear that Arthur has been travelling all along with a pocket Scrabble set 
from Earth.

    "Six by nine. Forty-two."
    "That's it. That's all there is."

Of course, 6 * 9 is 54, not 42. There are several possible interpretations of this. One would be 
that Arthur indeed discovered the Ultimate Question, which doesn't match the Answer simply 
because the universe is bizarre and irrational. Arthur Dent accepts this as being the reason in the 
radio series, when he remarks, "I always said there was something fundamentally wrong with the 
universe." However, this explanation is contradicted by the book, particularly by the fact that the 
Earth's computation of the Question had not finished when it was destroyed.

Another explanation is that the program (Earth) would have run correctly if not for the 
interference of events such as the crash landing of the Golgafrinchans. These important 
modifications introduced error into the program and caused it to discover the wrong question. 
This accounts for the irrational nature of the question in Arthur's mind, as he himself is a 
descendant of the Golgafrinchans. It could in fact be that the question in Arthur's mind is a 
warped version of the true question.

It is also possible, given Adams' often bleak view of technology (in the late 1970s), that the 6 * 9 
= 42 answer is meant to indicate that the Earth project was a flawed design to begin with, one 
that was always going to produce the wrong question even if the program had been run 
successfully.

Yet another possibility is that the letters were truly random, and by some extremely improbable 
coincidence happened to spell out an intelligible English question.

It was later pointed out by readers that 6 * 9 = 42 if the calculations are performed in base 13, 
not base 10. Douglas Adams has averred that he was not aware of this at the time, and repeatedly 
dismissed this as an irrelevant concoction, saying that "nobody writes jokes in base 13 [...] I may 
be a pretty sad person, but I don't make jokes in base 13."

Marvin's Question

Another possibility as to the Ultimate Question is presented in the third book, Life, the Universe 
and Everything. Often complaining about having a "brain the size of a planet", (this would 
presumably be necessary to work out the Question, as the Earth was created for this purpose 
according to the series, and is also, approximately, the size of a planet) and once stating that he 
can see the Question on Arthur's brainwaves, it is possible the "paranoid android" Marvin may 
know the Question. If this is true, it is possible that it may be given in the following paragraph, 
taken from Life, the Universe and Everything where Marvin is speaking to the mattress, Zem 
(Zem = Earth, in Slovak):

"...I am at a rough estimate, thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an 
example. Think of a number, any number." [said Marvin]

"Er, five" said the mattress.

"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?"

Given the situation, and other small clues which an enthusiast should read the book to discover, 
it is possible that the Ultimate Question is "Think of a number, any number." This would be 
ironic given that it is in fact not a question.

Impossibility of discovering the Ultimate Question

A joke about the impossibility of understanding the real meaning of the universe first appeared in 
Fit the Seventh of the radio series, in 1978. There it was stated:

    There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for 
and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something more bizarrely 
inexplicable.

    There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

The joke was reprinted in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe and re-worked into both 
Life, the Universe and Everything and The Tertiary Phase, based on the third novel. In the latter 
novel, Arthur encounters a man named Prak, who through a significant overdose of a remarkably 
effective truth serum has gained the knowledge of all truth. Prak confirms that 42 is indeed the 
answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything, but reveals that it is 
impossible for both the ultimate answer and the ultimate question to be known about the same 
universe (a sort of way to keep the key from the lock). He states that if such a thing should come 
to pass, the universe would disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarrely 
inexplicable. He then speculates that this may have already happened.

The mutual exclusion of knowing both the ultimate question and the ultimate answer mimics 
counter-intuitive principles of quantum mechanics like the Pauli exclusion principle and the 
uncertainty principle.
