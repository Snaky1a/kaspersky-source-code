1. INTRODUCTION
   FastScript is scripting library. It is intended for programmers who want

and Kylix 1-3.
   Unique feature of FastScript is ability to use several languages
(PascalScript, C++Script, JScript, BasicScript), so you can write scripts 
using your favourite language.

   FastScript is shareware. See "Registering" topic for details.

3. MISSING FEATURES
- No type definition (records, classes) inside script; no records, no pointers,
  no sets (but you can use 'IN' operator - "a in ['a'..'c','d']"), no
  shortstrings, no GOTO statement, no external dll calls.
- C++Script: no octal constants; no 'break' in the SWITCH operator (SWITCH
  works like Pascal CASE); '++' and '--' operators allowed only after the
  variable, i.e. '++i' is not allowed; '--', '++' and '=' operators doesn't
  return a value, i.e. 'if(i++)' is not allowed; identifiers are 
  case-insensitive; NULL constant is Pascal Null - use nil instead of NULL.
